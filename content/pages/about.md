My name is Hunter. Right now, I'm a software developer intern at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/). In the near future, I will have my software engineering degree from the University of Victoria.

For business-y inquiries, the best way to get in touch with me is to shoot an email to _hunter@hunterwatson.ca_
