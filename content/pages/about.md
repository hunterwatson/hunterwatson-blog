My name is Hunter. Right now, I'm a software developer intern at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/). In the near future, I will have my software engineering degree from the University of Victoria.

This blog is a place where I can dump information about various things I learn or come across. Although the posts are presented in a reader-oriented format, the content is mostly just for me, whether I'm documenting the steps to achieve a technical goal, collecting my thoughts about a particular album or artist, or jotting down something interesting that I don't want to forget. 

For business-y inquiries, the best way to get in touch with me is to shoot an email to _hunter@hunterwatson.ca_
