I tried using DuckDuckGo for a couple days (privacy, unbiased results, control, blah blah blah), but I found preceding every search with `!g`. DuckDuckGo has these things called _!Bangs_, which are "shortcuts that quickly take you to search results on other sites", according to [their website](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).
