  Being a 20-ish-year-old who hasn't matured enough to appreciate casual
  drinking during conversation, I frequently end up playing some kind of
  drinking game at events. Most of them are alright, some of them are okay, but
  none of them are exactly what I want. That's why I'm going to (try to) make
  one.
