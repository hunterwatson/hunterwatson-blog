  Being a 20-ish-year-old who hasn't matured enough to appreciate casual
  drinking during conversation, I frequently end up playing some kind of
  drinking game at events. Most of them are alright, some of them are okay, but
  none of them are exactly what I want. That's why I'm going to (try to) make
  one.

Picture this: you're at a pre-drink with some friends, some friends of friends, and that one friend of a friend who you sort of have a crush on. People are casually drinking and having a good time, but the vibe is kind of dying. Someone suggests you all play a drinking game and everyone agrees... but what game?

Beer pong is fun, but there's too many of you. Flip cup is exciting, but it doesn't give you a chance to really get to know each other. Your friend learned a new game while studying abroad, but no one really wants to learn the complicated rules. Games like King's Cup are great if you have a deck of cards, but the game quickly loses steam. Nothing is a perfect fit for the night.

From the _very_ limited research that I've done, there are **3 qualities of a good drinking game**:

1. The rules are simple
2. It brings people together
3. It is enjoyable

Those attributes create a fairly simple checklist for making a good drinking game. (1) Not everyone wants to learn a complex game when they're drinking, so the rules should be straightforward and minimal. (2) The game should be an icebreaker and allow participants to get to know one another better. (3) And finally, games should be fun. 

But what about the **3 qualities of a _great_ drinking game**:
1. The rules are simple, _and the game is easily accessible_
2. It brings people together, _regardless of how much they want to participate_
3. It is enjoyable, _with great replay value_

This list builds on the previous and adds some important clarifications. (1) Not only should the game be simple, but it shouldn't require obscure equipment. Games where someone needs to bring a kit (Drinking Jenga) or special set of cards (What Do You Meme) are inconvenient and require a pickup plan if you're going out. (2) Ideally, a great drinking game can be played by anyone, regardless of if they're not drinking, don't like being put on the spot, or have a significant other who isn't at the event. (3) Finally, a game shouldn't just be fun all the way through, but it should be fun to play again and again and again and again.

The closest thing I've come to a great drinking game is a mobile app called "Picolo" ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picolo-drinking-game/id1001473964)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picolo.android&hl=en_CA). The game is played on a single
