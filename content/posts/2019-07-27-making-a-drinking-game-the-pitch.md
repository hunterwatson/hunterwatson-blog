  Being a 20-ish-year-old who hasn't matured enough to appreciate casual
  drinking during conversation, I frequently end up playing some kind of
  drinking game at events. Most of them are alright, some of them are okay, but
  none of them are exactly what I want. That's why I'm going to (try to) make
  one.

Picture this: you're at a pre-drink with some friends, some friends of friends, and that one friend of a friend who you sort of have a crush on. People are casually drinking and having a good time, but the vibe is kind of dying. Someone suggests you all play a drinking game and everyone agrees... but what game?

Beer pong is fun, but there's too many of you. Flip cup is exciting, but it doesn't give you a chance to really get to know each other. Your friend learned a new game while studying abroad, but no one really wants to learn the complicated rules. Games like King's Cup are great if you have a deck of cards, but the game quickly loses steam. Nothing is a perfect fit for the night.

From the _very_ limited research that I've done, there are **3 qualities of a good drinking game**:

1. The rules are simple
2. It brings people together
3. It is enjoyable

Those attributes create a fairly simple checklist for making a good drinking game. (1) Not everyone wants to learn a complex game when they're drinking, so the rules should be straightforward and minimal. (2) The game should be an icebreaker and allow participants to get to know one another better. (3) And finally, games should be fun. 

But what about the **3 qualities of a _great_ drinking game**:

1. The rules are simple, _and the game is easily accessible_
2. It brings people together, _regardless of how much they want to participate_
3. It is enjoyable, _with great replay value_

This list builds on the previous and adds some important clarifications. (1) Not only should the game be simple, but it shouldn't require obscure equipment. Games where someone needs to bring a kit (Drinking Jenga) or special set of cards (What Do You Meme) are inconvenient and require a pickup plan if you're going out. (2) Ideally, a great drinking game can be played by anyone, regardless of if they're not drinking, don't like being put on the spot, or have a significant other who isn't at the event. (3) Finally, a game shouldn't just be fun all the way through, but it should be fun to play again and again and again and again.

The closest thing to a great drinking game I've played is a mobile app called "Picolo" ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picolo-drinking-game/id1001473964)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picolo.android&hl=en_CA)). Players put their names into a phone and the game cycles through "cards" with activities or rules on them. For example, one of them might be "Players who are an only child, drink 2 times" or "<player1>, choose between kissing someone or drinking 3 times". The prompts vary in intensity based on which mode you're playing (some are super sexual). 

Picolo is super easy to spin up at a party, since only one person needs to download the (free?) app to play. Prompts are rarely repeated, so the replay value is really high. The game is simple, it creates an opportunity to learn about other players, and it's fun. 

Although Picolo checks a lot of boxes, it also leaves a lot to be desired. There are numerous stupid prompts (mostly the yellow rule cards) that my friends almost always ignore. These are real mood killers and can ruin the flow of the game. Second, although there's a nice personal element of the game by including the players' names, it can lead to some awkward, but not the fun awkward, situations. For example, when the designated driver gets the "finish your drink" card, or when someone who is in a relationship is told to make out with someone else. Additionally, although the modes try to facilitate for different groups of players (colleagues, close friends, etc.), they seem to be a little off the mark. The base version is a little too dry for my friends, but the "Calient√©" mode is _wayyyy_ too sexual.

# Harmony

Harmony is an app-based drinking game that gives the player control over their experience. The gameplay is very similar to [Picolo](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/picolo/) or [Buzzed Drinking Game](https://www.amazon.ca/Buzzed-This-Drinking-Friends-Tipsy/dp/B07N338MT7), where a series of simple prompts containing rules or actions get players drunk. Customization is the main difference between Harmony and other app-based drinking games, from customizing the state and relationships of players to the prompts themselves.

## Player Rules

What if your game knew the players. What if it knew that Adam wasn't drinking, Britney and Charlie were a couple, Daniel will do almost anything, and Ethan has a crush on Fiona. With the option to configure player rules (player statuses and player relationships), Harmony is able to respect people's choices while simultaneously play matchmaker. It's a real crowd pleaser.

## Custom Prompts

Collections of prompts, sometimes referred to as cards, can be added or removed based on the vibe of the night. Each prompt has a "spiciness" rating from 1 to 5, where 1 is something you could play with your new coworkers and 5 is... intense. Before the game, players can set a range of what levels they want to play with. Additionally, new prompts will be consistently added to keep the game fresh.

The game will be freely available via a web browser (I don't know how to make mobile apps) and probably open source. There's no timeline for this project, but I'll post more about it during the development stages. My vision for Harmony fits my description of a _great_ drinking game, and hopefully I can actually follow through with it.

I just want everyone to have a good time.
