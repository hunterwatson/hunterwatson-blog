  Being a 20-ish-year-old who hasn't matured enough to appreciate casual
  drinking while conversing with friends, I frequently end up playing some kind
  of drinking game at events. Most of them are alright, some of them are okay,
  but none of them are exactly what I want. That's why I'm going to (try to)
  make one.

Picture this: you're at a pre-drink with some friends, some friends of friends, and that one friend of a friend who you sort of have a crush on. People are casually drinking and having a good time, but the vibe is kind of dying. Someone suggests you all play a drinking game and everyone agrees... but what game?

Beer pong is fun, but there are too many of you. Flip cup is exciting, but it doesn't give you a chance to really get to know each other. Your friend learned a new game while studying abroad, but no one really wants to learn the complicated rules. Games like King's Cup are great if you have a deck of cards, but the game quickly loses steam. Nothing is a perfect fit for the night.

From the _very_ limited research that I've done, there are 3 qualities of a good drinking game:

1. The rules are simple
2. It brings people together
3. It is enjoyable

But what about the 3 qualities of a **_great_** drinking game:

1. The rules are simple - _and the game is easily accessible_
2. It brings people together - _regardless of who they are and their state at the party_
3. It is enjoyable - _throughout the whole game, and it's replayable_

The closest thing to a great drinking game I've played is a mobile app called "Picolo" ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picolo-drinking-game/id1001473964)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picolo.android&hl=en_CA)). Picolo is simple, can be played with just a single phone and any number of people, and is usually pretty fun. It checks the boxes for a good drinking game but falls short when evaluated against my great game list.

Firstly, the game has some brain-dead prompts that aren't fun, leading to skipping of cards and a loss of momentum, for example:

* posting on Facebook
* "rule" cards that span multiple rounds
* extremely sexual cards

Second, the game lacks understanding about who the players are and their relationships. This can lead to some awkward, mood-killing situations, for example:

* the designated driver is told to finish their drink
* someone in a relationship has to do something romantic with someone other than their partner

So here's my app pitch:

# Harmony

Harmony is a personalized drinking game made for human beings.

## Player Rules

What if your game knew the players. What if it knew that Adam wasn't drinking, Britney and Charlie were a couple, Daniel will do almost anything, and Ethan has a crush on Fiona. With the option to configure player rules (player statuses and player relationships), Harmony is able to respect people's choices while simultaneously play matchmaker. It's a real crowd-pleaser.

## Curated Prompts

There are lots of prompt-based drinking games. Harmony would feature the best prompts from these games, and more importantly, not have any of the shitty ones.

## Custom Prompts

Collections of prompts, sometimes referred to as cards, can be added or removed based on the vibe of the night. Each prompt has a "spiciness" rating from 1 to 5, where 1 is something you could play with your new coworkers and 5 is... intense. Before the game, players can set a range of what levels they want to play with. Additionally, new prompts will be consistently added to keep the game fresh.
