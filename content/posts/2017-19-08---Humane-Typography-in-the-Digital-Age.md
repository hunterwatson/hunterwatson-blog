I was talking with my fellow interns about our personal workspace setups, and I was super surprised when two of them said they use the default Mac `terminal.app` with no customization whatsoever. I thought I was going to blow their mind when I whipped out my spiffy, colourful, dark-theme terminal prompt, but to my surprise, they were having none of it. 

"_Yeah, but it does the same stuff, so what's the point?_", one of them said. 

And then I froze... I didn't have a response. Was it true? Was my gorgeous, fully customized terminal equivalent to the default, out-of-the-box version despite the countless hours I've devoted to the iterative process of creative the perfect command prompt? Was everything a waste of time?

Or was I just so used to my _power-user-enabled_, _ergonimically-crafted_, _beeaaauuutiful_, that the advantages became second nature? Was I so comfortable with the brainchild I created that I started to take it for granted?

The answer is... probably something in between. Anyways here's a little guide on how I set up my terminal.
