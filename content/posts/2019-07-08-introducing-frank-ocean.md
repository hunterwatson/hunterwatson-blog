Frank Ocean, born Christopher Edwin Cooksey in 1987 (_he's 31 as I'm writing this_), is an American artist who's music challenges typical pop or r&b labels. Although Frank Ocean has [expressed his distaste for genres](https://thequietus.com/articles/07450-frank-ocean-interview), I would describe his music as alternative r&b meets neo-soul meets every positive and negative memory you've had in the last 10 years of your life forming into one meets nostalgia that you haven't experienced yet. Okay maybe that's hyping him up too much but it's hard to describe his music other than "really nice".

Ocean's career started as a ghostwriter for pop stars like Beyonc√©, John Legend, and Justin Bieber. He was inducted into the Los Angeles-based hip-hop collective Odd Future, where he turned his focus away from composing music for others and towards working on his own shit.

## nostalgia, ULTRA (Mixtape) [2011]

Frank Ocena's first official release was [_Nostalgia, ULTRA_](https://oddfuture.bandcamp.com/album/nostalgia-ultra), which has a fairly uplifting tone despite exploring some heavier topics like inter-personal relationships and self-reflection. 

The project is peppered with interludes, and features a bunch of cassette tape sounds. Around the time of the release, "_mixtapes_" were the DJ-hosted, bangers only type projects (think Lil Wayne), but the constant cassette noises brings us back to the "hand to your crush by the lockers" definition.
