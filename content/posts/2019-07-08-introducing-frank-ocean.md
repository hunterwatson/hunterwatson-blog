Frank Ocean, born Christopher Edwin Cooksey in 1987 (_he's 31 as I'm writing this_), is an American artist who's music challenges typical pop or r&b labels. Although Frank Ocean has [expressed his distaste for genres](https://thequietus.com/articles/07450-frank-ocean-interview), I would describe his music as alternative r&b meets neo-soul meets every positive and negative memory you've had in the last 10 years of your life forming into one meets nostalgia that you haven't experienced yet. Okay maybe that's hyping him up too much but it's hard to describe his music other than "really nice".

One thing that I want to mention right away is the _mood_ of Frank Ocean's records. Depending on how _I'm_ feeling, I'll either sit in silence, completely still and listen to the lyrics, or I'll have a huge smile on my face, singing along. And that's the case for almost all of his songs. Sometimes events will happen in my life and a song will mean something totally different to me or inspire some new emotions.

# Frank Ocean's Journey

## Early Years

Ocean's career started as a ghostwriter for pop stars like Beyonc√©, John Legend, and Justin Bieber. He was inducted into the Los Angeles-based hip-hop collective Odd Future, where he turned his focus away from composing music for others and towards making his own music.

## Nostalgia Ultra

On Feb 16, 2011, he released the mixtape [_Nostalgia, ULTRA_](https://oddfuture.bandcamp.com/album/nostalgia-ultra), which pairs topics like interpersonal relationships and self-reflection with intelligent and subtle songwriting. The whole album feels really insightful to me, but nothing feels like a stretch and it all feels relatable. The tape also has a fairly uplifting tone despite exploring some not-so-uplifting concepts. 

The mixtape, in true mixtape fashion, samples instrumentals from The Eagle's Hotel California on _american wedding_, and MGMT's Electric Feel on _nature feels_, which are two stand-out tracks. Unfortunately due to legal stuff with sampling, the mixtape will not be coming to popular streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify. The mixtape also has some experimental cuts like _there will be tears_, which features auto-tuned vocals over simple, piano-based production before a high-energy beat switch. 

The project is peppered with interludes related to video games and feature the sounds of operating a cassette player, demonstrating that this "mixtape" is like a traditional cassette mixtape you would hand someone by the lockers, and not a DJ-hosted "bangers only" mixtape (think Lil' Wayne).
